              <h2>Understanding Mountain Gorillas</h2>
              <p>
                Mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) are one of the
                most endangered species on Earth, with only about 1,000
                individuals remaining in the wild. They are found in just three
                countries: Rwanda, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

                  <h4>Physical Characteristics</h4>
                  <p>
                    Adult males can weigh up to 400 pounds and stand 5.5 feet
                    tall when upright. They have distinctive silver backs, which
                    is why dominant males are called "silverbacks."

                <div class="info-card">
                  <h4>Social Structure</h4>
                  <p>
                    Gorillas live in family groups led by a dominant silverback.
                    Groups typically consist of 5-30 individuals, including
                    females, juveniles, and infants.

                  <p>
                    Gorillas are generally peaceful and gentle creatures. They
                    spend most of their time eating, resting, and caring for
                    their young.

              <h2>Planning Your Gorilla Trek</h2>

              <h3>When to Go</h3>
              <p>
                Gorilla trekking is available year-round in Rwanda, but the best
                times to visit are during the dry seasons:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>June to September:</strong> Long dry season - best for
                  trekking
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>December to February:</strong> Short dry season - also
                  excellent
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>March to May:</strong> Long rainy season - more
                  challenging but fewer tourists
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>October to November:</strong> Short rainy season -
                  lush landscapes
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Gorilla Permits</h3>
              <p>
                Gorilla permits are mandatory and cost $1,500 per person. They
                should be booked well in advance, especially during peak season.
                Permits include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Guided trek with professional trackers</li>
                <li>One hour with the gorillas</li>
                <li>Conservation fees</li>
                <li>Community development contributions</li>
              </ul>

              <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>⚠️ Important Note</h4>
                <p>
                  Gorilla permits are limited and often sell out months in
                  advance. Book your permits at least 6-12 months ahead,
                  especially for peak season visits.

                    While gorillas can catch human diseases, the risk is minimal
                    with proper precautions. Visitors with colds or other
                    illnesses should postpone their trek.

                    flash photography. Follow your guide's instructions at all
